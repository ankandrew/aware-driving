### Intro

**Aware Driving** (AD) is a mobile app that will assist you while you are driving. Use it with your regular smartphone,
thereâ€™s no need to buy extra equipment. We use AI/Machine Learning to alert when you are **asleep**, **distracted** or
your **face can't be clearly seen**. **_Share_** this app to whoever may need it!
